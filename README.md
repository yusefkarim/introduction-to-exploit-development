This repository contains all the material I wrote for an advanced reading course during my final semester of university.
It involves learning the basics of exploit development on Linux for both the x86 and ARM architecture.

# What was achieved?

## 0. Lab Setup
- Very basic information about what I used for my x86 and ARM lab machines.
## 1. Introduction To Stack Overflows
- Beginners introduction to the basics of stack overflows

## 2. Exploiting Stack Overflows With Shellcode on x86 and ARM
- The meat of these writeups!
- Explains and provides information on how to write your own shellcode for x86 and ARM
- Walks through exploiting stack overflows using both the NOP sled and ROP methods for x86 and ARM

## 3. Exploiting Heap Overflows on ARM
- Short introduction on what the heap is
- Basic example of how to exploit a heap-based vulnerability on ARM

## 4. Bonus Presentation
- Slide based presentation I did at the end of the course
- Shows how to escalate priviliges when exploiting a vulnerable SUID executable
